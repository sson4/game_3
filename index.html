<h2>Mosquito Spray</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Spray the mosquito.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    I want them to grow a hatred for mosquito and test their reaction time.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
    Shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
    Use the mouse cursor to aim the can of bug spray at the mosquito. Once the mosquito is in sight, right-click on the mouse to unleash spray. The number of mosquito will increament by 1 each time you finish a level. So keep your eyes sharp because if the mosquito touch you the game will end.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
    This prototype objective is to inform player that there is a solution to bugs infestation. Bug spray can kill every bug in sight especially pesky mosquito.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
    360 degree aim, Increasing difficulty after each level, Fix point position (player can't move only aim), Raining enemies, Tried to incorperate score board and game over screen but ran into trouble implementing it.
</li>

    You playing as a can of bug spray that try to enjoy the sun on a sunny day. But yesterday it rained and gave raise to many mosquito army. Therefore, you must do your job as a bug spray.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    Outdoor people that enjoy camping trip. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
    5 mins.

    Pick your shot wisely because you can only shoot one bullet at a time. You cannot shoot again until the bullet you shot before leave the screen. Try to line up the bug because bullet goes through multiple bugs.
